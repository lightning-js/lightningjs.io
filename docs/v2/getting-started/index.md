# Getting Started Guide


This  guide helps you through the steps of developing a (*blueprint*) App using the Lightning SDK.
<!-- This App will serve as a starting point when you are going to [develop a (VOD) App](../C_Development/index.md). -->

> The Lightning SDK requires that the App project's file and folder structure is configured properly. The procedure described in this Guide ensures this.


Before starting off, you have to [install the Lightning CLI](InstallCLI/index.md) on your system (if you haven't already done so) by running the command `npm install -g @lightningjs/cli` in your command prompt.


If the Lightning CLI is installed, perform the following steps to develop a new Lightning App:

1. [Create a New Lighting App](CreateApp/index.md)
2. [Run Your App](RunApp/index.md)
3. [Try Out Your App](TryOutApp/index.md)
